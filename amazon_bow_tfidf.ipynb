Saw the reviews here and thought \"Come on people, it's just a package,\" but then when we actually had to deal with it (after having used the good ole fashioned big round canister). No, it's not world ending, but it's just unnecessary annoyance that you don't need when you're low on sleep and changing poop-filled diapers all day. I suppose on the bright side, the new packaging likely helped to justify the continued employment of a few folks in Enfamil's Brand Marketing department (\"Based on our focus group testing, modernizing our packaging will boost sales by .14%!\"). In this tough job market, I say good on 'em.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the formula itself, well, it's formula. Our baby drinks this just the same as if she were drinking generic Costco formula. We put out the extra cash because this mixed better (i.e., it doesn't clump), but the annoyance factor of the new Enfamil packaging actually made us start considering alternatives. Then we saw an article today on Huffpost about infants in China developing breasts because of hormones in formula. It also mentioned the lack of regulation in the US on using milk or milk products (e.g., formula) from cows that have been injected with growth hormones. That was enough for me. Organic formula it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ciao Enfamil.</td>\n",

       "1  To add to the pile-on, really really hate the new packaging. Saw the reviews here and thought \"Come on people, it's just a package,\" but then when we actually had to deal with it (after having used the good ole fashioned big round canister). No, it's not world ending, but it's just unnecessary annoyance that you don't need when you're low on sleep and changing poop-filled diapers all day. I suppose on the bright side, the new packaging likely helped to justify the continued employment of a few folks in Enfamil's Brand Marketing department (\"Based on our focus group testing, modernizing our packaging will boost sales by .14%!\"). In this tough job market, I say good on 'em.<br /><br />As for the formula itself, well, it's formula. Our baby drinks this just the same as if she were drinking generic Costco formula. We put out the extra cash because this mixed better (i.e., it doesn't clump), but the annoyance factor of the new Enfamil packaging actually made us start considering alternatives. Then we saw an article today on Huffpost about infants in China developing breasts because of hormones in formula. It also mentioned the lack of regulation in the US on using milk or milk products (e.g., formula) from cows that have been injected with growth hormones. That was enough for me. Organic formula it is.<br /><br />Ciao Enfamil.  \n",
